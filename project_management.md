# Project Objectives

-   [ ] **User Login/Register System**

    -   Implement a secure user authentication system allowing new users to register and existing users to log in.
    -   Ensure password security through hashing and validation checks.
    -   Provide user profile management features for updating personal information.

-   [ ] **Roles and Authorization**

    -   Define user roles (e.g., players, mayor) and implement role-based access control.
    -   Ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions based on their roles.
    -   Implement middleware to enforce authorization rules across the application.

-   [ ] **Lobby System**

    -   Develop a lobby where users can join or create game sessions.
    -   Display a list of available lobbies and allow users to join or leave lobbies.
    -   Implement a waiting area where users wait until a game session starts.

-   [ ] **Game Rounds Management**

    -   Implement the logic for handling multiple game rounds, each lasting 10 years.
    -   Ensure different rules and scenarios are applied for each round (monarchy, communal, private ownership).
    -   Track and update the state of the game (e.g., pasture health, number of cows) after each round.

-   [ ] **Player Actions and Decision Making**

    -   Allow players to make decisions on the number of cows to release, buy, or sell each round.
    -   Implement the process for players to submit their decisions simultaneously.
    -   Ensure real-time updates and immediate feedback on the consequences of player actions.

-   [ ] **Resource Management and Regeneration**

    -   Implement the rules for pasture usage and regeneration as described in the document.
    -   Calculate the impact of grazing on pasture health and update the game state accordingly.
    -   Simulate the natural regeneration of the pasture based on unused portions.

-   [ ] **Mayor and Rule Enforcement**

    -   Develop functionalities for the mayor to monitor and enforce game rules.
    -   Implement mechanisms for the mayor to issue penalties for rule violations.
    -   Allow the mayor to communicate privately with players regarding rule enforcement.

-   [ ] **Validation and Error Handling**

    -   Ensure all player inputs are validated to prevent invalid actions and cheating.
    -   Implement comprehensive error handling to provide clear feedback to users.
    -   Validate game state transitions to ensure consistency and integrity of the game data.

-   [ ] **Communication and Collaboration**

    -   Facilitate communication among players, especially in the rounds where collaboration is allowed.
    -   Implement a messaging system for players to discuss strategies and make collective decisions.
    -   Ensure communication is recorded and accessible for review.

-   [ ] **User Interface and Experience**
    -   Design an intuitive and engaging user interface that guides players through the game.
    -   Provide visual feedback on game state changes and player actions.
    -   Ensure responsive design for optimal gameplay experience on various devices.
